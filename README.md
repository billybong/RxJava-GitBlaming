RxJava-GitBlaming
=================

Give a boot to all top committers of the project you wish you never included in your dependencies. Reactive style!

Have you ever wished that you could tell the committer of a particular project you've been dragging your hair out over to just f**k off? Now you can! Using reactive streams, RxJava, Retrofit and the FOAS (F**k of as a service) cloud infrastructure!

No seriously - this is just some random code i shat out while playing around and learning RxJava.
