RxJava-GitBlaming
=================

Give a boot to all top committers of the project you wish you never included in your dependencies. Reactive style!

Have you ever wished that you could tell the committer of a particular project you've been dragging your hair out over to just sod off? Now you can! Using reactive streams, RxJava, Retrofit and the FOAAS (F##k of as a service) cloud infrastructure!

No seriously - this is just some random code i shat out while playing around and learning RxJava.
All coders and open source community members should have a great hug rather than a FO, but as no one has yet to implement the LBAAS (LoveBomb As A Service) the FOAAS will have to do.
